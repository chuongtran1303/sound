# ---------------------------- SOUND SENSOR PROJECT --------------------------

This project is meant to collect sound level at a proximity of a Rasberry Pi 
device. The RPI is equipped with a USB sound card (C-Media Electronic, Inc. Audio Adapter) 
and a microphone. The sound is recored at 1600HZ sample rate and every second will produce 
80 pieces of RMS value as a bar-diagram. In the sound file, 8 pieces of data will be printed 
out by a .php file to a .txt file
